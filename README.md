# SKEDroid_SKCC
This is a simple app to allow amateur radio ("ham radio") operators with Internet access to view and participate in the [K3UK Straight Key Century Club Sked](http://www.obriensweb.com/sked/index.php?page=skcc) page from their Android devices.

### Installation of Skedroid for SKCC
Download the SKEDroidSKCC.apk file to your phone.

NOTE: Anyone installing this app (which is an ".apk" file) will need to change the setting on their phone to allow installation of non-market applications:

To find this setting on versions of Android prior to 4.0, go to "Settings > Applications" and then check the box next to "Unknown Sources". For devices running Android 4.0 or above, go to "Settings > Security" or "Settings > Security & Screen Lock" and then check the box next to "Unknown Sources" and confirm your choice.

### Notes on the Source
Note: The source code (.aia) files are not executable Android programs. The source code is also not Java SDK code -- it can only be loaded into App Inventor.

### About the SKCC
[SKCC](http://skccgroup.com/) "is the fastest growing group of mechanical-key CW operators in the world. First organized in January 2006, our club has grown rapidly to include thousands of licensed amateur-radio operators from all corners of the globe."

### Kudos to MIT's App Inventor
This application was made using the [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/).
