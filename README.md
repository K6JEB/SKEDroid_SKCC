# SKEDroid_SKCC
This is a simple app to allow amateur radio ("ham radio") operators with Internet access to view and participate in the [K3UK Straight Key Century Club Sked](http://www.obriensweb.com/sked/index.php?page=skcc) page from their Android devices.  [Andy O'Brien K3UK](http://www.obriensweb.com/k3uk.html) has put together a terrific website for the SKCC community, and so this Android app will hopefully extend its usefulness out into the field and away from our indoor hideaways, at least a bit more often. (hi hi)

### Installation of SKEDroid for SKCC
Download the SKEDroidSKCC.apk file to your phone.

NOTE: Anyone installing this app (which is an ".apk" file) will need to change the setting on their phone to allow installation of non-market applications:

To find this setting on versions of Android prior to 4.0, go to "Settings > Applications" and then check the box next to "Unknown Sources". For devices running Android 4.0 or above, go to "Settings > Security" or "Settings > Security & Screen Lock" and then check the box next to "Unknown Sources" and confirm your choice.

### Notes on the Source
Note: The source code (.aia) files are not executable Android programs. The source code is also not Java SDK code -- it can only be loaded into App Inventor.

### About the SKCC

### Kudos to MIT's App Inventor
This application was made using the [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/). "MIT App Inventor is a blocks-based programming tool that allows everyone, even novices, to start programming and build fully functional apps for Android devices. Newcomers to App Inventor can have their first app up and running in an hour or less, and can program more complex apps in significantly less time than with more traditional, text-based languages."

### DEVICE ACCESS
Do you want to install this application? It will get access to:
* full network access
* view network connections
* view Wi-Fi connections

This access is solely for the application to view and interact with the SKCC Sked page.
