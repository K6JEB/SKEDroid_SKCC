# SKEDroid_SKCC
This is a simple app to allow amateur radio ("ham radio") operators with Internet access to view and participate in the [K3UK Straight Key Century Club Sked](http://www.obriensweb.com/sked/index.php?page=skcc) page from their Android devices.


[SKCC](http://skccgroup.com/) "is the fastest growing group of mechanical-key CW operators in the world. First organized in January 2006, our club has grown rapidly to include thousands of licensed amateur-radio operators from all corners of the globe."

This application was made using the [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/).
